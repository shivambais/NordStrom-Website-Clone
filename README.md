### About Project

> In Masai School, after completing every unit we have a Construct Week. During Construct week students collaborate and build a website clone. As a part of First Construct week we were allocated to build Nordstrom Website clone. We tried our best to clone this website using HTML, CSS and Javascript within given time frame of seven days. We added some common functionalities like a dropdown navigation bar, header, footer, Sigup, Login, sorting on products by brand and their price, product pages, cart page, checkout page, hover effects on text and images etc.
